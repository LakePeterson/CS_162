# CS 162 Intro to Comupter Science II

This repository is an archive of all the programming assignments for CS 162 at Oregon State University taken winter quarter 2018, taught by Rob Hess.

## Course Description

In this course we learned about, file I/O, object-oriented programming principles, program design, debugging/testing
algorithm analysis, recursion, dorting and searching, linear data structures. By the end of the course, we are able to:

- Design and implement programs that require:
  - multiple classes and structures
  - Hierarchies of classes that use inheritance and polymorphism
  - An understanding of abstraction, modularity, and separation of concerns
- Construct and use basic linear structures (arrays, stacks, queues, and various linked lists) in programs, and be able to    describe instances appropriate for their use.
- Classify moderately complicated algorithms in these complexity classes: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), and O(n2).
- Develop test data sets and testing plans for programming projects.
- Produce recursive algorithms and choose appropriately between iterative and recursive algorithms.
